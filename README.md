## Hello there, I'm Victor.

Fullstack Software Engineer with over 14 years of experience in software development, with a primary focus on Front-end and strong specialization in React.js (+6 years) and Next.js (+3 years). I also have proven experience in React Native (+6 years), being able to work with both efficiently.

My expertise includes creating robust web and mobile interfaces, and although my focus is Front-end, I have experience in Node.js for back-end development.

I have strong knowledge in DevOps and automation, with experience in containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) in GCP (GKE) and AWS (EKS) environments. I have solid experience in implementing CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI and Bitrise for Android and iOS applications, as well as cloud environments.
