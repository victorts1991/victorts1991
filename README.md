## Hello there, I'm Victor.

With over 14 years of experience as a Software Engineer, including the last 6 years dedicated to React, React Native, Node.js, CI/CD and Kubernetes at Google Cloud. I work as a Full Stack Engineer with a proven track record in building scalable and efficient solutions, mainly using React.js, Node.js, GCP and AWS.

My expertise covers the full development cycle, from creating robust web interfaces with React.js and performant mobile applications (Android/iOS with React Native), to backend development with Node.js. I have experience with frameworks such as NestJS and TypeORM for microservices, in addition to working with serverless architectures via Firebase Functions and implementing unit and e2e tests.

I have strong knowledge in DevOps and automation, with experience in containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes), and a solid background in implementing CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment, with a focus on AWS environments (GitHub Actions), GCP environments (Gitlab CI and Cloud Build) and the Google and Apple app stores (Bitrise).

### Academic Background:

- Specialist in Software Architecture from Fiap;
- Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the University of Mogi das Cruzes;
