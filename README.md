## Hello there, I'm Victor.

Full Stack Engineer with over 14 years of experience in software development, with solid experience in React.js (+6 years), Node.js (+3 years), Kubernetes (+3 years), and CI/CD (+4 years).

My expertise covers the full development cycle, from creating robust web interfaces with React.js to backend development with Node.js. I have experience with frameworks such as NestJS and TypeORM for microservices, as well as working with serverless architectures via Firebase Functions.

I have strong knowledge in DevOps and automation, with experience in containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) in GCP and AWS environments, and a solid background in implementing CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment, with a focus on AWS environments (GitHub Actions), GCP environments (Gitlab CI and Cloud Build), and the Google and Apple app stores (Bitrise).
