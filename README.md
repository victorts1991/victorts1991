## Hello there, I'm Victor.

Frontend Software Engineer with +14 years of experience, specialized in React.js (+6 years), React Native (+4 years), Next.js (+2 years), CI/CD (+4 years) and Kubernetes (+4 years), with experience in the Information Technology, Education, Property Security and Transportation/Logistics industries.

Among the highlighted projects:

- Real-Time Incident Notification System: Architected and developed the user interface (UI) using React.js, focusing on a real-time, low-latency experience (via Firebase Firestore integration). The UI's performance and clear data visualization were essential in reducing the team's incident response time by 70% and increasing problem-solving effectiveness by 50%;
- Web Portal Performance Optimization (Next.js): Provided technical leadership for the migration of a legacy web portal to Next.js, resulting in a significant improvement in Core Web Vitals and boosting the application's SEO score by 35%. Optimized the Time to Interactive (TTI) by 2 seconds using Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to deliver a superior user experience;

My extended experience in CI/CD, Docker and Kubernetes (AWS/GCP) allows me to operate as a full-cycle Frontend engineer, understanding the application's lifecycle from development to deployment and observability. I am a proactive and innovative professional who explores technologies like Generative AI (OpenAI) to optimize development processes and approaches.
